# Week 3 Assignment: Control Flows and Functions

## Overview

This is the Week 3 assignment for the Power Learn project, completed by Yonatan Berihun. The focus of this assignment is on control flows and functions in Python.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement control flow statements (if, else, etc.)
- Create functions to encapsulate logic and promote code reuse
- Apply user input to perform calculations based on conditions

## Functionality

The primary function implemented in this assignment is `calculate_discount`, which calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount based on user input.

### Function Details

- **Function Name**: `calculate_discount`
- **Parameters**:
  - `price`: The original price of the item (float).
  - `discount_percent`: The discount percentage (float).
- **Returns**: 
  - The final price after applying the discount if the discount is 20% or higher.
  - The original price if the discount is lower than 20%.

### Usage

1. The program prompts the user to enter the original price of an item.
2. It then asks for the discount percentage.
3. Based on the input, it calculates and displays the final price.

### Example

```python
Enter the original price of an item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Your final price is: $75.0
```

## Requirements
